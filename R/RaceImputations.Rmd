# Race Imputations

two reasonably simple strategies (both single imputation): 

1) hot deck imputation 

  missing values are assigned based on 
  
2) random number generator w/ race proportions targets to decide


not doing multiple imputation or other more complex forms because I'm not trying to predict the race distribution or really accurately capture the variance in a regression - I am using the race distributions we know about (active partnerships) to assign race values to ones we don't (inactive partnerships)

we assume no race distribution difference between active & inactive, but we do stratify targets (or "donors") by ego sex, race, and relatoinship type (marcoh/other)
